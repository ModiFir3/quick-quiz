This website is going to be perfect for new or junior level level web devs who want to test their knowledge. Within this website you will be able to take a “Quick Quiz” that will be multiple choice. The user will have 60 seconds to answer all the questions before the time runs out. The user will also have a penalty if they answer the questions wrong. A score will go up for any questions they get right and will also display at the top of the quiz. At the end of the quiz the user will be able to write their username and save it to the website.
